[Include detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to download and run your code (test from beginning before submitting)
Describe each requirement you did or did not fulfill, including details the TA should know about where and how you implemented it; perhaps this can be done in the report instead
Describe any additional files you include, or any add-ons / libraries your submission uses and how the TA can add them to the project
List your Operating System and CPU so that you ran your code on in your README file as an extra point to debug possible errors
